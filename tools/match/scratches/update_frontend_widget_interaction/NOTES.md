# cRBorder::AI @ 0x402820

Current recovery: semantic-complete (`compiler,references` residual). Binary
Ninja types the Windows entry as `void __thiscall(FrontendWidget*)`; the active
BOD dispatcher ignores callback results. Android and iOS independently retain
the same complete member as `cRBorder::AI()` in `Border.o`.

The recovered state machine covers flag snapshots and list teardown, mouse and
shortcut dispatch, delayed actions, tooltip/twinkle updates, text input,
RePosition/Draw, color easing, sound feedback, cursor history, and all three
slider children. Exact sibling methods corroborate its owner and field graph.

Focused VC6 result: **95.83%**, 649/647 candidate/target instructions, prefix
127/647, with 96 clean relocation operands and two candidate-only unaudited
`1.0f`/`0.0f` clamp loads. The remaining differences are bounded initialization,
x87 interpolation, and endpoint-store scheduling, not missing behavior.

The matcher source now uses the authored `AI` method and exact VC6 symbol
`?AI@cRBorder@@QAEXXZ`; `update_frontend_widget_interaction` remains only the
stable scratch and Windows-address identity.
