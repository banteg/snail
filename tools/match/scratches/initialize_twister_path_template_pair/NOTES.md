# initialize_twister_path_template_pair

Starter reconstruction for `initialize_twister_path_template_pair @ 0x42a540`.

Models the 34-sample twister template with handedness-dependent phase, sinusoidal
vertical offset, previous-sample orientation reconstruction, delta recomputation,
generated mesh, facequads, and finalization.

The scratch keeps the real six-argument constructor signature used by the path
bank callsites, including the unused vertical texture argument. Remaining work is
register scheduling and exact loop form.

2026-06-21 helper-inline sweep: native flattens the scratch-local helper layer.
Forcing those helpers inline moves focused Wibo from 10.97% (125/677
candidate/target instructions) to 14.36% (590/677), with masked operands
improving from 11 ok, 0 unresolved, 8 mismatch to 26 ok, 0 unresolved, 3
mismatch.

2026-07-03 twister source-order pass: narrowing secondary sample initialization
to transform-only writes, preserving the native `0.5f * 5.0f` center scale
spelling, and storing the sine-derived primary `y` / `z` after
`set_matrix_identity` moves focused Wibo to 15.25% (556/677), with masked
operands cleaned up to 30 ok, 0 unresolved, 0 mismatch. Rejected adjacent probe:
the kind42-style mesh `vertex_index` spelling was neutral at 14.36%, so the
strip-mesh vertex cursor remains pointer-shaped for now.

2026-07-03 retained sample-scalar cleanup: primary sample setup now omits the
scratch-only `lateral_source` zero store and follows the native scalar store
order: `rotation_scalar_98`, `rotation_scalar_94`, `special_scalar`,
`lateral_scale`. Focused Wibo moves from 15.25% (556/677) to 15.27%
(554/677), with masked operands unchanged at 30 ok, 0 unresolved, 0 mismatch.
Rejected adjacent probe: extracting an endpoint-handedness helper regressed the
focused score to 15.00% (563/677) and reintroduced two masked call mismatches.

2026-07-03 rejected interior-X probe: unlike `wibble`/`invert`, forcing the
interior sample initializer to keep transform `position.x` at 0.0f regressed
focused Wibo from 15.27% (554/677) to 14.16% (552/677) and regressed the masked
audit from 30 ok, 0 unresolved, 0 mismatch to 20 ok, 0 unresolved, 4 mismatch.
